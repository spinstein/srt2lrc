First at all, I have totally no idea about code. I forked the program 'cause I need it.
But there's still a little issue. For example

00:00:00,674 --> 00:00:01,988

[Voiceover] Hello grammarians.
2
00:00:01,988 --> 00:00:04,082
Welcome to the English parts of speech.

3
00:00:04,082 --> 00:00:06,630
We're gonna begin with the noun,

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,626
the lovely wonderful noun,
your friend and mine.

5
00:00:09,626 --> 00:00:12,660
They're mostly what you're
gonna encounter in sentences.

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,728
Most sentences in English
contain at least one noun

7
00:00:15,728 --> 00:00:18,848
or a pronoun, but we'll
get to pronouns later.

8
00:00:18,848 --> 00:00:22,827
A noun is basically anything.

9
00:00:24,417 --> 00:00:28,506
And I know that's not an
especially helpful definition,

10
00:00:28,506 --> 00:00:31,574
but we'll get more specific in a minute.

11
00:00:31,574 --> 00:00:34,070
A noun is basically anything at all.

12
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,410
Now the way this is taught
in traditional grammar

13
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,973
is to say that a noun is
a person, place or thing,

14
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:44,522
which is fine, I think we can
make that a little bit sharper

15
00:00:44,522 --> 00:00:47,077
and expand that out by
saying that they are,

16
00:00:47,077 --> 00:00:51,152
that nouns are people or living things,

17
00:00:51,152 --> 00:00:52,725
places,

18
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:59,069
things, or ideas.

19
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:03,063
I think ideas is the one
that usually gets left out.

20
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:07,532
So nouns can be people,
places, things and ideas.

21
00:01:07,532 --> 00:01:09,533
Let's put that in action.

22
00:01:10,993 --> 00:01:13,648
So, this is Raul.

23
00:01:13,648 --> 00:01:15,596
He is from Argentina.

24
00:01:15,596 --> 00:01:17,416
He is a penguin.

25
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:19,870
Raul has big dreams.

26
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:20,930
Now, okay.

27
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,824
So, I wanna take these three sentences

28
00:01:22,824 --> 00:01:26,074
and find the noun in them using the test.

29
00:01:26,074 --> 00:01:30,070
So the test is, is it a person

30
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:33,702
or a living thing, a place,

31
00:01:33,702 --> 00:01:37,620
a thing, or an idea?

32
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,366
And if it's any of those things,

33
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:42,054
then it falls into the
category of words in English

34
00:01:42,054 --> 00:01:44,127
which we call nouns.

35
00:01:44,127 --> 00:01:45,823
So, sentence number one.

36
00:01:45,823 --> 00:01:47,573
This is Raul.

37
00:01:48,873 --> 00:01:50,069
What is Raul?

38
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:52,781
Well, Raul is a person or a living thing

39
00:01:52,781 --> 00:01:56,151
so we're just gonna say person so noun.

40
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:59,069
Next sentence.

41
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:01,708
He is from Argentina.

42
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:04,612
Now Argentina happens to be a place

43
00:02:04,612 --> 00:02:06,436
so therefore, it is also a noun.

44
00:02:06,436 --> 00:02:08,356
It's a kind of noun called a proper noun,

45
00:02:08,356 --> 00:02:10,900
just like Raul is but
we'll get to that later.

46
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,868
So, Argentina is a noun.

47
00:02:12,868 --> 00:02:15,640
Argentina incidentally is a country

48
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,024
and the word country is also a noun

49
00:02:19,024 --> 00:02:21,962
because it is a thing.

50
00:02:23,488 --> 00:02:24,951
So, sentence the third.

51
00:02:24,951 --> 00:02:27,313
He is a penguin.

52
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,951
Now, a penguin is a
living being or a thing

53
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:35,223
so we can say oh yes, penguin,
that is a noun as well.

54
00:02:35,223 --> 00:02:39,903
So, you've noticed I'm
not circling he or this.

55
00:02:39,903 --> 00:02:42,903
These words are pronouns,
relative pronouns,

56
00:02:42,903 --> 00:02:45,807
and they can sometimes behave like nouns,

57
00:02:45,807 --> 00:02:48,256
but I wouldn't call them nouns.

58
00:02:48,256 --> 00:02:49,408
That'll just get confusing.

59
00:02:49,408 --> 00:02:51,652
So, these are pronouns and
we'll get to them later.

60
00:02:53,562 --> 00:02:54,763
Sentence number four.

61
00:02:54,763 --> 00:02:56,850
Raul has big dreams.

62
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,266
So, here we have Raul again.

63
00:02:58,266 --> 00:03:01,074
We know from the first sentence
that it's a person's name.

64
00:03:01,074 --> 00:03:04,289
So, we're just gonna say
this is also a noun again.

65
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:06,233
And dreams.

66
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:08,657
Now, dreams isn't a person, a place.

67
00:03:08,657 --> 00:03:11,153
It's a thing, sure.

68
00:03:12,253 --> 00:03:14,921
The reason I put in idea
as a fourth category is

69
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:17,986
to get it stuff that you can't pick up.

70
00:03:17,986 --> 00:03:21,078
Like for example, so dream,
yes, dream is a noun.

71
00:03:23,058 --> 00:03:24,859
Dream is maybe a little tangible

72
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:27,023
'cause it's something you can imagine,

73
00:03:27,023 --> 00:03:30,526
but the idea of like a word like bigness.

74
00:03:32,686 --> 00:03:35,438
Or if you prefer, you know, size.

75
00:03:40,238 --> 00:03:45,052
The size of Raul's
plumage was astonishing.

76
00:03:46,202 --> 00:03:48,255
Look at that gorgeous plumage.

77
00:03:48,255 --> 00:03:50,473
It's a little penguin mohawk.

78
00:03:50,473 --> 00:03:52,455
(high-pitched murmurs)

79
00:03:52,455 --> 00:03:55,801
The size of Raul's plumage was astounding.

80
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:58,392
Now in that sentence, size is a noun,

81
00:03:58,392 --> 00:04:00,860
but it's not a physical thing,

82
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,290
it's not a person, it's not a place,

83
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,578
it's not something you can pick up.

84
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:05,644
It's an idea.

85
00:04:05,644 --> 00:04:08,010
So, that's why I include
this fourth category.

86
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,844
So, if you're trying to figure out

87
00:04:10,844 --> 00:04:12,950
whether or not a word is a noun,

88
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,614
just apply this test.

89
00:04:14,614 --> 00:04:17,760
Ask yourself, is it a person, a place,

90
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,753
a thing, or an idea?

91
00:04:21,555 --> 00:04:24,262
And you, my friend, will be golden.

92
00:04:24,262 --> 00:04:25,944
You can learn anything.

93
00:04:25,944 --> 00:00:00,000

After running this program, I did got a lrc file, like this below:

[00:00.67]- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians.
[00:01.98]

[00:55.45]things, or ideas.

[01:00.57]I think ideas is the one that usually gets left out.
[01:03.06]
[01:03.06]So nouns can be people, places, things and ideas.
[01:07.53]
[01:07.53]Let's put that in action.
[01:09.53]
[01:10.99]So, this is Raul.
[01:13.64]
[01:13.64]He is from Argentina.
[01:15.59]
[01:15.59]He is a penguin.
[01:17.41]
[01:17.41]Raul has big dreams.
[01:19.87]
[01:19.87]Now, okay.
[01:20.93]
[01:20.93]So, I wanna take these three sentences
[01:22.82]
[01:22.82]and find the noun in them using the test.
[01:26.07]
[01:26.07]So the test is, is it a person

[01:33.70]a thing, or an idea?
[01:37.62]
[01:37.62]And if it's any of those things,
[01:39.36]
[01:39.36]then it falls into the category of words in English
[01:42.05]
[01:42.05]which we call nouns.
[01:44.12]
[01:44.12]So, sentence number one.
[01:45.82]
[01:45.82]This is Raul.
[01:47.57]
[01:48.87]What is Raul?
[01:50.06]
[01:50.06]Well, Raul is a person or a living thing
[01:52.78]
[01:52.78]so we're just gonna say person so noun.
[01:56.15]
[01:57.91]Next sentence.
[01:59.06]
[01:59.06]He is from Argentina.
[02:01.70]
[02:01.70]Now Argentina happens to be a place
[02:04.61]
[02:04.61]so therefore, it is also a noun.
[02:06.43]
[02:06.43]It's a kind of noun called a proper noun,
[02:08.35]
[02:08.35]just like Raul is but we'll get to that later.
[02:10.90]
[02:10.90]So, Argentina is a noun.
[02:12.86]
[02:12.86]Argentina incidentally is a country
[02:15.64]
[02:15.64]and the word country is also a noun
[02:19.02]
[02:19.02]because it is a thing.
[02:21.96]
[02:23.48]So, sentence the third.
[02:24.95]
[02:24.95]He is a penguin.
[02:27.31]
[02:27.31]Now, a penguin is a living being or a thing
[02:30.95]
[02:30.95]so we can say oh yes, penguin, that is a noun as well.
[02:35.22]
[02:35.22]So, you've noticed I'm not circling he or this.
[02:39.90]
[02:39.90]These words are pronouns, relative pronouns,

[02:49.40]
[02:49.40]So, these are pronouns and we'll get to them later.
[02:51.65]
[02:53.56]Sentence number four.
[02:54.76]
[02:54.76]Raul has big dreams.
[02:56.85]
[02:56.85]So, here we have Raul again.
[02:58.26]
[02:58.26]We know from the first sentence that it's a person's name.
[03:01.07]
[03:01.07]So, we're just gonna say this is also a noun again.
[03:04.28]
[03:04.28]And dreams.
[03:06.23]
[03:06.23]Now, dreams isn't a person, a place.
[03:08.65]
[03:08.65]It's a thing, sure.

[03:50.47]
[03:50.47](high-pitched murmurs)
[03:52.45]
[03:52.45]The size of Raul's plumage was astounding.
[03:55.80]
[03:55.80]Now in that sentence, size is a noun,
[03:58.39]
[03:58.39]but it's not a physical thing,
[04:00.86]
[04:00.86]it's not a person, it's not a place,
[04:02.29]
[04:02.29]it's not something you can pick up.
[04:04.57]
[04:04.57]It's an idea.
[04:05.64]
[04:05.64]So, that's why I include this fourth category.
[04:08.01]
[04:08.01]So, if you're trying to figure out
[04:10.84]
[04:10.84]whether or not a word is a noun,
[04:12.95]
[04:12.95]just apply this test.
[04:14.61]
[04:14.61]Ask yourself, is it a person, a place,
[04:17.76]
[04:17.76]a thing, or an idea?
